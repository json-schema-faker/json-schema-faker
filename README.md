## What's next?

Breaking-changes towards `v0.5.x` API:

- **deprecated** &mdash; You will not longer be able to call `jsf()` and get a fully-dereferenced result. It will just generate given refs and inline ones, nothing else.
  - `jsf.generate()` is the sync-version, with partial dereferencing through given refs, etc.
  - `jsf.resolve()` is the async-version, with full dereferencing, given refs are also supported.
- **deprecated** &mdash; TypeScript sources are not longer used, however `d.ts` definitions will be updated on time.

> Usage info from README.md was moved to `docs/`, [read more](docs/).
