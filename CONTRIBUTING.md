Contribution to the project is more than welcome!

Please stick to the following rules:

* When submitting *bugs* (or inappropriate behavior), do *paste your schema example* if only it's possible. This will prevent us from explicitly asking you to do this.
* When submitting *PRs*, ship them under the `develop` branch.
* The testing approach architecture is described in [spec/README.md](spec/README.md).
* For commits, in order to pass the tests, the developer will need a coveralls.io account synced with github. Lack of it will result in 422 Error (see [this failed travis job](https://travis-ci.org/ducin/json-schema-faker/builds/62396254))
* Releasing new version should:
  * include a new entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file,
  * be followed by rebuilding and re-releasing new online demo, see [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/pateketrueke/json-schema-faker/tree/gh-pages).
